## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**READ THIS FIRST:**

This guide involves modifying SSD firmware using mass production tools (MP Tools). This process carries significant risks:

- **You can permanently brick your SSD** if done incorrectly
- **There is NO recovery** from a failed flash - the drive becomes unusable
- **You will void any warranty** on the SSD
- **This may violate RED's terms of service**
- **Use at your own risk** - we are not responsible for any damage to equipment

**Recommendation:** Practice on an inexpensive SSD first before attempting on your primary drive.
