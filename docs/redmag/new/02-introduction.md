## Introduction

### What This Guide Does

The DSMC camera restricts recording features (resolution, frame rate) when it detects non-RED branded storage media. This isn't a security measure - it's feature gating to encourage purchase of RED's proprietary (and expensive) storage solutions.

This guide teaches you how to configure a generic SSD to be recognized as authentic RED media, unlocking full camera capabilities at a fraction of the cost:

- **RED 256GB REDMAG:** $500+ (if you can find one)
- **Generic 256GB SSD:** $30-50
- **Savings:** ~90%

### What Gets Unlocked

Once your SSD is properly configured:
- ✅ Full resolution recording (up to 4K)
- ✅ High frame rates (up to 120fps depending on resolution)
- ✅ No "not authorized" warnings
- ✅ All camera features enabled
- ✅ Camera treats it as genuine RED media

### Skill Level Required

**Moderate** - You should be comfortable with:
- Installing and using Windows software
- Connecting hardware (USB adapters, cables)
- Following technical instructions carefully
- Accepting the risk of bricking a drive

**Time Required:** 2-4 hours (including research and testing)
